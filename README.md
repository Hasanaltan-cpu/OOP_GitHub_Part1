# OOP_GitHub_Part1

<h2>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</h2>

 -OOP is faster and easier to execute
 
 
 -OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
 
 
 -OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
 
 
 -OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

 As you see; in this picture, we have some variable parameters which is important for us.In addition to that, we don't want to them would be changeable.That's why we use this method and we will protect this from the others also with encapsulation prodives us to reach this private field.
 
 <h2>Inheritance<h2>

  Logic of  inheritance is same in the biology in terms of usage logic.Firstly,we created a BaseClass.This class can be called "Parent Class" for the other classes.In this phase u can not create an object because of OOP SOLiD rules.
 
 
 <h2>What is an Interface Class?<h2>
  
  
 
  An interface is not a class. It is an entity that is defined by the word Interface. An interface has no implementation; it only has the signature or in other words, just the definition of the methods without the body. As one of the similarities to Abstract class, it is a contract that is used to define hierarchies for all subclasses or it defines specific set of methods and their arguments. The main difference between them is that a class can implement more than one interface but can only inherit from one abstract class. Since C# doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance, interfaces are used to implement multiple inheritance.
